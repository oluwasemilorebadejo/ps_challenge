- wrap charge and chargeJob service into function
- handle axios error - socket hang up
- a card can be used in two different rooms so i cant return based off the unique signature, except i am checking the room the signature belongs to?
- handle all types propery esp those coming from paystack that return any
- create a function to handle all the findOne and returns 404 error, i am guessing that is what the repository is for
- handle validation
